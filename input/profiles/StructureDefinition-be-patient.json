Systems providing decision support or enforcing business rules should ideally do this on the basis of Observations dealing with the specific sex or gender aspect of interest (anatomical, chromosomal, social, etc.)  However, because these observations are infrequently recorded, defaulting to the administrative gender is common practice.  Where such defaulting occurs, rule enforcement should allow for the variation between administrative and biological, chromosomal and other gender aspects.  For example, an alert about a hysterectomy on a male should be handled as a warning or overridable error, not a \"hard\" error.  See the Patient Gender and Sex section for additional information about communicating patient gender and sex.\n\nSpecial remarks for KMEHR users: \n\nPlease note gender in KMEHR is typically expressed using CD-SEX.

This is however a functionally different concept from the generalPractioner as it is defined in the FHIR resource.

Systems providing decision support or enforcing business rules should ideally do this on the basis of Observations dealing with the specific sex or gender aspect of interest (anatomical, chromosomal, social, etc.)  However, because these observations are infrequently recorded, defaulting to the administrative gender is common practice.  Where such defaulting occurs, rule enforcement should allow for the variation between administrative and biological, chromosomal and other gender aspects.  For example, an alert about a hysterectomy on a male should be handled as a warning or overridable error, not a \"hard\" error.  See the Patient Gender and Sex section for additional information about communicating patient gender and sex.\n\nSpecial remarks for KMEHR users: \n\nPlease note gender in KMEHR is typically expressed using CD-SEX.

As such, the base resource of this is considered sufficient here. The KMEHR standard defines a contact as a separate element using a value from the KMEHR CD-ITEM table and an appropriate value from CD-CONTACT-PERSON to describe the relation to the patient in the KMEHR message. When needed, using FHIR, the contactperson is included in the FHIR resource Patient. Use cases implementing this contact SHALL be aware not all information of CD-CONTACT-PERSON is covered by the base valueset. The codesystem ‘https://www.ehealth.fgov.be/standards/fhir/CodeSystem/CD-CONTACT-PERSON’ SHALL be used to refer to any codes previously used in a KMEHR context that cannot be covered by the base HL7 valueset.",

For animals, language is not a relevant field, and should be absent from the instance. If the Patient does not speak the default local language, then the Interpreter Required Standard can be used to explicitly declare that an interpreter is required.\n\nSpecial remarks for KMEHR users:\n\nThe 'usuallanguage' element in a KMEHR message only refers to the use of W3C language codes. As such, the language codes as proposed in the FHIR standard should not present any interoperability issue. Note the KMEHR element implies it is the language usally used by the patient. As such, when this element from KMEHR would be mapped to a FHIR resource, the communication.preferred Boolean SHOULD be used."

This is however a functionally different concept from the generalPractioner as it is defined in the FHIR resource. (Consult the published definition on the HL7 webpage) It is also possible in KMEHR to add a general practioner via an item and using the correct value from CD-ITEM. That way is functionally closer to the general practioner referenced here.
